# ESP-32_repo
Repository consists of the file and projects that I made using the ESP-32.


In these Projects and files i use Aurdino onlineIDE(Cloud) and AurdinoCreateAgent for uploading the code on NodeMCU ESP-32s. I have tried VS Code PlatformIO. But, I found little bit confusing there. So, I tried different, You can use VScode also no issues. I found Aurdino online IDE is little bit more easy and less confusing. Projects are fun.
